    <h2>My Experience</h2>
    <ul class="experience">
        <li>
            <strong>Private Contractor Apprentice</strong> for a private contractor (March 2020 - August 2021)
            <p>At this job I was an appretntice of a small private contractor located in NorthSmithfield RI. Although I was 
                considered the young apprentice I was given higher responsibilites for my hard work and my consistency in my work.
               </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Busser/Expo</strong> at Texas Roadhouse (January 2022 - July 2022)
            <p>At this job I joined as a table busser. This job did get very busy and required you to be calm under pressure 
                and to be self directed. After about a month the manager told me that she reconginized my strong work ethic
            and appreciated my hard work, saying I stood out from other employees. I was promoted to Expo on the cook line and this role
            brought more responsibilites, required to work under more pressure, and required me to learn fast. This role I worked 
            well under the pressure and I learned valuable skills on how to be a fast-learner and solve problems as they arise.</p>
        </li>
    </li>
        <strong>Locksmith Technician </strong> at  Atlantic Locksmiths (March 2023 - September 2024)
        <p> At this job I learned valuable traits such as critical thinking, learning fast, working under pressure, 
        and learned a strong work ethic. I required critical thinking when on a job and a problem occured, I had a limited time 
        to complete the job and I needed to solve the problem in a cost and time effective way. I had perfect attendance and 
        took pride in my punctaulity.</p>
    </li>
